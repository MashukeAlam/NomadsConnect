# GitHub Actions workflow to deploy NomadsConnect application to a remote server
#
# This workflow runs on push events to the main branch and pull requests targeting the main branch.
# It checks out the latest code, SSHs into the server, stops existing Docker containers,
# pulls the latest changes, and starts Docker containers with the updated code.
#
# Ensure secrets for SSH_HOST, SSH_USER, SSH_PRIV, SSH_PASSPHRASE, and SSH_PORT are set in repository settings.
